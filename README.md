## ðŸ“– Project Idea

This project started as a way to make linear algebra less abstract and more *visible*.  
It combines two main parts:

### Vector & Matrix Visualizer  
- Plot vectors in 3D  
- Explore spans of lines and planes  
- Check independence  
- Play with linear combinations  

The main objective of my project is visualize vector s[ace of more than three Dimension.
###  Interactive Agent  
A simple conversational math assistant built with **LangChain**.  
Instead of writing out NumPy code, you can just ask questions like:  



##  Features

- **3D Vector Visualization**  
  Plot vectors in 2D/3D, see how they add, subtract, and form spans .

- **Matrix Operations**  
  Determinant, inverse, transpose, rank, and matrix multiplications â€” through NumPy.

- **Ploting or visual representation**  
  - Linear independence check  
  - Dimension of spans  
  - Linear combinations with adjustable coefficients  

- ** AI Agent**  
  Ask math questions in simple language :  
  - `Add [1,2,3] and [4,5,6]` â†’ `[5,7,9]`  
  - `Determinant of [[1,2],[3,4]]` â†’ `-2.0`  
  - `Are [[1,2,3],[2,4,6]] independent?` â†’ `False`
