##  Features

- **3D Vector Visualization**  
  Plot vectors in 2D/3D, see how they add, subtract, and form spans .

- **Matrix Operations**  
  Determinant, inverse, transpose, rank, and matrix multiplications — through NumPy.

- **Ploting or visual representation**  
  - Linear independence check  
  - Dimension of spans  
  - Linear combinations with adjustable coefficients  

- ** AI Agent**  
  Ask math questions in simple language :  
  - `Add [1,2,3] and [4,5,6]` → `[5,7,9]`  
  - `Determinant of [[1,2],[3,4]]` → `-2.0`  
  - `Are [[1,2,3],[2,4,6]] independent?` → `False`
